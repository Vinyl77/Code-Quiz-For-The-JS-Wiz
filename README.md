# Code-Quiz-For-The-JS-Wiz
With this project, I had to review the weeks topics to go through this task.  With the help of a tutor, study group, and google I was able to hash it out.  Understanding the basics of Web API's was easy, applying it was a bit harder.

# Application
I created the html and with help decided to do two different html files, one for the quiz itself and one for the scores.  With that being said then we decided that there would be two different javascript links also.  There wasn't much css involved, but some was used.

* Start button to start quiz
* Timer starts keeping time once start button is clicked
* Question and answers pop up on the page, if answer is wrong User is penalized 10 seconds
* Either user finishes first or time runs out
* User enters initials and is entered into score storage page
* User can compare other users scores.
* User can return to the start page to take the quiz again.

# Technology
